Flare
=====

Flare is a collection of Barback transformers for content generation.
The typical use case is the static generation of web sites (e.g. similar
to Jekyll, etc).


Status
------

Flare is currently just an experiment. The goal is to validate the hypothesis
that Barback is versatile enough to support an extensible static content generation
system. I am publishing this as a package in the hope to receive feedback 
from the community. Pull requests will not hurt either ;-)

 
Example
-------

A preliminary example is [available here](https://github.com/gmosx/dart-flare_example).
