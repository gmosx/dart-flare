Flare
=====

Flare is a collection of Barback transformers for static generation of web sites,  
similar to Jekyll, etc.


Transformers
------------

* MarkdownTransformer
* MetadataExtractor
* MetadataAggregator
* PostsIndexer
* PostsTransformer
* MustacheTransformer
* CleanupTransformer


Status
------

Flare is currently just an experiment. The goal is to validate the hypothesis
that Barback is versatile enough to support an extensible static site generation
system. I am publishing this as a package in the hope to receive feedback 
from the community. Pull requests will not hurt either ;-)

The API is *not stable* yet!
