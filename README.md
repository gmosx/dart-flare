# Flare

Flare is a collection of Barback transformers for static generation of web sites,  
similar to Jekyll, etc.

## Usage

A preliminary example is [available here](https://github.com/gmosx/dart-flare_example).

## Command-line interface

Before using the the CLI you have to activate it using the following command:

    $ pub global activate flare

Then you have access to a number of helper options:

    $ flare generate-post-id
    $ flare new-post "This is my new post"
    $ flare new-post --date=2014/08/02 "This is another post"

## Transformers

Flare provides the following default set of transformers:

### MetadataExtractor

Extracts front-end metadata from content files and transforms the data to the
internal JSON format.

### MetadataTranslator

Transforms external metadata to the internal JSON format.

### MetadataAggregator

Aggregates all metadata files into a single metadata structure accessible through
the [site] global variable.

### MarkdownTransform

Renders Markdown markup into HTML.

### PostsIndexer

Computes indexing metadata for the posts.

### PostsTransformer

Renders a collection of posts.

### MustacheTransformer

Renders Mustache templates into HTML files.

### CleanupTransformer

Removes temporary files generated by the content generation process.

### HtmlOptimizer

Optimizes the generated HTML files by removing comments and squeezing whitespace.

## Status

Flare is currently just an experiment. The goal is to validate the hypothesis
that Barback is versatile enough to support an extensible static site generation
system. I am publishing this as a package in the hope to receive feedback 
from the community. Pull requests will not hurt either ;-)

The API is *not stable* yet!
