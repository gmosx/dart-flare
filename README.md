Flare
=====

Flare is a collection of Barback transformers for content generation.
The typical use case is the static generation of web sites (similar to Jekyll, etc).

Flare is currently just an experiment. The goal is to validate the hypothesis
that Barback is versatile enough to support an extensible static site generation
system. I am publishing this as a package in the hope to receive feedback 
from the community. Pull requests will not hurt either ;-)

The API is *not stable* yet!
